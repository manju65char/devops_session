what is cloud : 

cloud computing : 
it refers to the data and applications being stored and run on the cloud rather than being stored on local machine or on premises 


who ?

elasticity 

cost savings 

deploy globally in minutes 


types : 

IAAS

SAAS 


IAAS 
vm , Storage , network components 

PAAS : 
vm , Storage , network components + OS 

Container service , eks, elastic bean stalk 

developers and devops 

SAAS : 

IAAS + PAAS 


google drive 

Gmail  -> 

end user or customers 


cloud computing deployment models : 

public cloud 

private cloud vpc / on premises 

Hybrid 

mutli cloud 

aws , azure , gcp 


region : us-east-1

AZs : us-east-1a, us-east-1b , us-east-1c, us-east-1d

Linux os depends on kernel 

system depends on Linux os

Linux file/dir/folders structure 


/ -> root directory /main / top level 


all other dir known as ---> sub directories 

/bin -> binary dir -> it holds the essential user command binaries that all user can access 

it contain all executable files and Linux utilities (commands )

ex: shell scripts ,  ls , mv , yum , apt, rm ... reside here 


/etc --> to store the system-wide  configuration . acting as control panel on Linux 

hosts -> dns mapping file  -> dns resolution  user -->  amazon.com ---> dns resolver ---> 2.2.3.2 --> respond back to the user  -> 
passwd -> this file holds users , Michael 
group -> 
sudoers ->  sudo configuration 


/home -> User home dir -> it contains the home directories for users  and other accounts 

/home/Michael


/var -> variable files  --> logs , mail, print etc 

journalctl --> 

=========================

/usr -> user binaries -> multi user utilities , applications , and libraries 

/usr/bin/bash
git add .

/sbin -> system admin  for system maintenance and troubleshooting 

fdisk , ifconfig , reboot 


/opt -> optinal dir , SonarQube, tomcat, nexus , maven and so on ..


/svc -> server specific services related data 


ex : web servers files , (apache, httpd, nginx ) can be stored here 


/tmp -> temporary files --> created by system or users 


/proc -> process information 

/dev --> devices files , hard disk, usb , cd rom

/lib 
/mnt 
/media
/boot
/root -> root user or admin user 

/run 
/usr/local 
/lib64 ->
